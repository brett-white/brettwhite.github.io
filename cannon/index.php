                    <h3>We trust in the tested. We buy the right assets at the right price, because this is how successful investors have created wealth through the years. We know what works, and that “this time” is never different.</h3>
                    <p>We look beyond the speculative thinking and short-term myopia of the herd. Through our rigorous research process, we seek out opportunities, locally and across the globe, across all asset classes, to find the best investments for today — and for tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>And then we are patient. Because we know that perseverance and resilience are rewarded. In this way, over the past twenty years, we have developed a reputation for results. From pension funds and insurance companies to high-net-worth individuals and retail investors, our long-standing relationships with our clients are the testament to our success.</p>

                        <br>To stick to your guns, to stand your ground;
                        <br>To see through the illusion of safety in numbers,
                        <br>The false comfort that comes with conformity.
                        <br>It takes conviction to move ahead of the herd,
                        <br>Firm in knowing what’s right,
                        <br>Particularly when it’s the unpopular;

                        <p>It takes patience to watch an investment grow;
                        <br>To weather the storms, the cycle of seasons;
                        <br>To withstand the hot flushes and the cold money,
                        <br>To persevere in the face of bears —
                        <br>And to stare down bellowing bulls.
                        <br>To see beyond the right here and the just now,
                        <br>To build from experience
                        <br>And look to tomorrow to light the way,
                        <br>Surefooted in the knowledge of where you are
                        <br>And where you’re headed.
                        <br>That’s resilience.</p>

                        <br>To deliver: consistently and generously.
                        <br>To sacrifice and give of your all,
                        <br>Even in the face of criticism and cynicism.
                        <br>While it is the purview of all,
                        <br>It is the purpose of few,
                        <br>To put others first. That’s honour.
                        <br>As the sage says,
                        <br>You know a tree by it’s fruit.
                        <br>That’s results.</p>
